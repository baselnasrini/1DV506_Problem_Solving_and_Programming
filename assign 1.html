	      <P/>

       <LI><B>Setup Eclipse Workspace</B></BR>
	      Before you start programming, do the following.
	     <UL>
	     <LI>
		Create an Eclipse <em>workspace</em> (a folder) with the name <tt>java_courses</tt> on some location in 
		your home directory.
	     <LI> Create a <EM>Java project</EM> with the name <TT>1DV506</TT> inside the workspace.
	     <LI> Create a <em>package</em> with the name <TT>YourLnuUserName_assign1</TT> inside the 
	     project. For example, it might look something like  <TT>wo222ab_assign1</TT>.
	     <LI> Save all program files from the exercises in this assignment inside the  package <TT>YourLnuUserName_assign1</TT>.

	     <LI> In the future: create a new package (<TT>YourLnuUserName_assignX</TT>) for each assignment and a new 
	     project (with the course code as name) for each new course using Java.
	     </UL>
	      </LI>
	      <P/>
      
	      <LI><B>Edit, compile and execute.</B></BR>

   /* The classical "Hello World!" program. */
   public class Hello {
      
       public static void main(String[] args) { 	
          System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Print

	      <LI><B>Printing</B></BR>
	     Write a program <TT>Print.java</TT>, which will print the phrase <EM>Knowledge is power!</EM>

	     <UL>

	     <LI><B>Input</B></BR>

	     Write a program <TT>ReadName.java</TT>, that uses the class <TT>Scanner</TT> for 
	     reading a first name and a last name (given name and family name). After that the 
	     full name should be printed on one line. An example of an execution:
	      <PRE>

    Give a last name:  Bond
    
    Full name: James Bond
	      </PRE>
	     </LI>
	     <P/>
-->	     
	     		
	     <li><b>Quote</b><br/>
 		Write a program <TT>Quote.java</TT> which reads a line of text (using class <TT>Scanner</TT> ) 
 		and then prints the same line as a quote (that is inside <TT>" "</TT>).
 		An example of an execution:
 		<PRE>
    Write a line of text:  I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair.
    Quote: "I wish I was a punk rocker with flowers in my hair."
		</PRE>

<!--	     
	     <LI><B>Read real numbers</B></BR>

	     Write a program <TT>Compute.java</TT> using the class <TT>Scanner</TT> to read two real numbers, 
	     compute and print their sum, difference and product.	     </LI>
	     <P/>
-->	     
	     <LI><B>Number of seconds</B></BR>
	     Write a program <TT>Seconds.java</TT> which reads three integers (hours, minutes, seconds) 
	     and then computes the corresponding time measured in seconds. For example, 1 hour, 28 minutes 
	     and 42 seconds is equal to 5322 seconds. An example of an execution: 
		<pre>
     Hours: 1
     Minutes: 28
     Seconds: 42

     Total time measured in seconds: 5322
		</pre>
	     </LI>
	     <P/>
	     

	     
	     <li><b>BMI</b><br/>
		Write a program <tt>BMI.java</tt> which computes the BMI (Body Mass Index) for a person. 
		The program will read length and weight from the keyboard and then present the result as 
		output. The BMI is computed as weight/(length)^2, where the length is given in meters and 
		the weight in kilograms. An example of an execution: 
		<pre>
    Give your length in meters: 1,83
    Give your weight in kilograms: 83
    Your BMI is: 25
		</pre>
		Note: the BMI is always an integer. 
		</li>
		<p/>
		
		<li><b>Time</b><br/>
Write a  program <tt>Time.java</tt>, which reads a number of seconds (an integer) and then prints 
the same amount of time given in hours, minutes and seconds. An example of an execution:
<pre>
    Give a number of seconds: 9999
    This corresponds to: 2 hours, 46 minutes and 39 seconds.
</pre>
Hint: Use integer division and the modulus (remainder) operator.
</li>
<p/>



<li><b>Sum of Three</b><br/>
Write a  program <tt>SumOfThree.java</tt> which asks the user to provide a three digit number. 
The program should then compute the sum of the three digits. For example:
<pre>
    Provide a three digit number: 483
    Sum of digits: 15
</pre>
</li>
<p/>

<h3 style=color:#0000cc>If Time Permits</h3>
Exercise 11 is marked as <em>VG task</em> ==> only mandatory for those of you that aspire for a higher mark (A or B).<p/>
	     
	     <LI><B>Change</B> (VG-task)</BR>
	     Write a program <tt>Change.java</tt> that computes the change a customer should receive 
	     when he has paid a certain sum. The program should exactly describe the minimum number 
	     of Swedish bills and coins that should be returned rounded off to nearest krona (kr). 
	     Example:
	     <PRE>
Price: 372.38
Payment: 1000

Change: 628 kronor
1000kr bills: 0
 500kr bills: 1
 100kr bills: 1
  50kr bills: 0
  20kr bills: 1
  10kr coins: 0
   5kr coins: 1
   1kr coins: 3

	     </LI>
	     <P/>
	     

<h3 style=color:#0000cc>Lecture 3 - Using Library Classes</h3>

<li><b>Fahrenheit to Celsius</b><br/>
Write a  program <tt>Convert.java</tt>, which reads a temperature in Fahrenheit and 
then converts it to Celsius using the formula:
<pre>
    C = (F-32)*5/9
</pre>
The result should be presented with a single decimal correctly rounded off.
</li>
<p/>

<li><b>Short Name</b><br/>
Write a program ShortName.java, reading a first name and a last name (given name and family name) as two Strings. The output should consist of the first letter of the first name followed by a dot and a space, followed by the first four letters of the last name. An example of an execution:
<pre>
    First name: Anakin
    Last name: Skywalker
    Short name: A. Skyw
</pre>
Hint: Use methods of the String class.<br/>
What will happen if the last name consists of less than four letters?
</li>
<p/>


<li><b>Random Number</b><br/>
Write a program <tt>TelephoneNumber.java</tt>, generating and printing a random telephone number 
of the form <tt>0XXX-ZYYYYY</tt>. The area code consists of a zero followed by three digits (X). 
The local number can not start with a zero (Z), all other digits (Y) are random.<br/>

Hint: Use the class <tt>java.util.Random</tt>. 
</li>

<p/>

<li><b>Square Root</b><br/>
Write a program <tt>Distance.java</tt> which reads two coordinates in the form (x,y) and then 
computes the distance between the points, using the formula
<pre>
distance = Sqrt( (x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2 )
</pre>
Sqrt() means "the square root of" and ^ means "raised to". The answer should be presented with 
three decimal digits.<br/>

Hint: Use the class <tt>java.lang.Math</tt> for the computations.
</li>
<p/>

<h3 style=color:#0000cc>If Time Permits</h3>
Exercise 16 is marked as <em>VG task</em> ==> only mandatory for those of you that aspire for a higher mark (A or B).<p/>

<LI><B>Wind Chill</B> (VG-task)</BR>

	     Write a program <TT>WindChill.java</TT> that asks the user for a temperature (Â°C) 
	     and the wind speed (measured in m/s) and then computes the so-called <em>wind chill temperature</em> using
	     <a href="http://www.lenntech.com/calculators/wind/wind-chill.htm"> Siple's formula.</a>
	      
	     For example:
	      <PRE>
    Temperature:  -7.8
    Wind speed:  8.4
    
    Wind Chill Temperature: -24.5
	      </PRE>
